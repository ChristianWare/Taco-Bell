## Description:

This website is a redesign of Taco Bell's web page. I thought thier websie could use a refesh so I took it upon myself to take on this challenge. I wanted the main focus on the site to be the menu, since the menu on Taco Bell's website is not currently on their home page (you have to navigate to another page to see it). The menu I created is able to be filtered to show breakfast, lunch, and all items on the menu at the same time. The Site is mobile responive, and received high scores on Google's Page Speed Insights. There is also a breif "about" section, a social media section with links to external pages, and a newletter sign up area towards the bottom. Feel free to visit the demo link above.

## Technologies:

This Single Page Application was built with Next JS and React. The Data for the menu items is being pulled from a headless CMS, Contentful, with the "getStaticProps" function in NextJs. It is styled using CSS Modules. The dependencies used were react-icons, and the contentful CLI. The images were optimized for production, and are lazy loaded on the page. THis is all possible becasue of the Image component from Next JS.
